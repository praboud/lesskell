Lesskell
========

A complete reimplementation of the LESS preprocessor language for CSS.

I would be shocked if this ever got any use - I just thought it would
be fun to write. Haskell doesn't get much use in a web development
environment, so it isn't a natural choice for implementing a CSS
preprocessor.
